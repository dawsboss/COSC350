## Mini Test 2 | Question 3

* Contiguous allocation - Data is stored in a straight line. All you need to know is how much data there is and where it starts to access all. It is the most straightforward method, and deleting data in this methods could 
lead to large holes in the middle of the data

* Linked-List allocation - Each block of data holds its data in the address to the next data block. This is 
slow to read since the cursor for the data has to jump around the memory randomly.

* linked-List allocation with FAT (File Allocation Table) - Instead of each block of data holding its data in the address to the next one, each node holds its data, and then there is a table that holds all the nodes addresses for each link separately. This isn't good because the table becomes quite large quickly and is in the main memory. But better than a regular linked list since it doesn't have to rely on the nodes for addresses, making the data nodes smaller (so we can have more) and the read time fast since the addresses are in main memory. 

* Index-Node - It also has a table that stores the data's addresses but is only loaded into memory when the file is opened. So instead of the whole table in memory, we only have currently used files in memory. (saving memory space)
